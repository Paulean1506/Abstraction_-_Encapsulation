# Paulean Marguerette F. Parrish
# BSCPE 1-4
# (The Fan class).  Design a class named Fan to represent a fan. The class contains:

# Three constants named SLOW, MEDIUM, and FAST with the values 1, 2, and 3 to denote the fan speed.
class Fan:
    SLOW = 1
    MEDIUM = 2
    FAST = 3

    # A private int data field named speed that specifies the speed of the fan.
# A private bool data field named on that specifies whether the fan is on (the default is False).
# A private float data field named radius that specifies the radius of the fan.
# A private string data field named color that specifies the color of the fan.
# The accessor(getters)  and mutator(setters)  methods for all four data fields.
# A constructor that creates a fan with the specified speed (default SLOW), radius (default 5), color (default blue), and on (default False).
